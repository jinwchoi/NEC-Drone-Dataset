# NEC-Drone-Dataset
This repo is for the NEC-Drone-Dataset and the action recognition from drones project. For the details, see our [full paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/papers/Choi_Unsupervised_and_Semi-Supervised_Domain_Adaptation_for_Action_Recognition_from_Drones_WACV_2020_paper.pdf).

Please send an email to nec-drone-request@nec-labs.com, with cc to grv@nec-labs.com and jchoi@nec-labs.com for requesting access to the dataset. We are still fine-tuning the sharing process, so kindly give us a few business days time to get back to you.
